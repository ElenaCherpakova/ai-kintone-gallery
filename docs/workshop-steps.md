## Get Started

First, let's download the [sean-kintone/publish-to-medium](https://github.com/sean-kintone/publish-to-medium) Repo and go inside the folder.

Once you are inside the folder, let's install the dependencies!

```shell
cd Downloads

git clone https://github.com/sean-kintone/publish-to-medium

cd publish-to-medium

npm install

npm install -g @kintone/customize-uploader
```

## Create a Kintone Web Database App

Let's create a Kintone App with some Shapes and Sizes to display!

Here are the required fields & their configurations for our workshop:

| Field Type | Field Name | Field Code        | Note                                    |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Blank Space|    ---     | `publishToMedium` | This is where our button will attach    |
| Text       | Title      | `title`           | The title of our medium.com article     |
| Text       | Body       | `body`            | The body text of our medium.com article |

Be sure to click the **Save** and **Activate App** buttons! üí™

## Create a Medium API Token

## Get Your Medium Author ID

We can easily get our Medium.com Author ID from our terminal, now that we have our API Token. In the root folder (publish-to-medium) copy and paste the following curl command, replacing MY_API_TOKEN with your token.

```shell

cd publish-to-medium

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer MY_API_TOKEN" https://api.medium.com/v1/me | json_pp

```

Here is the curl command with a dummy token:

```shell

cd publish-to-medium

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer 2d6755756a12c743b4312f85fad0246a7953c68b78ef19c9efef134ef6dd8a429" https://api.medium.com/v1/me | json_pp

```

This will return your Author ID and other information in the terminal like so:

``` shell
{
   "data" : {
      "id" : "1df66a8dd2779709d3ca3b3526a4a0190972b8fe95afc7412eebdc4d0030f0549",
      "imageUrl" : "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/400/400/1*YfWnpcmJZnwmHpO-bSnzNA.png",
      "name" : "Kintone Developer Relations",
      "url" : "https://medium.com/@kintone_devrel_jp",
      "username" : "kintone_devrel_jp"
   }
}
```

Copy and keep the "id" string, as we will be pasting into our .env file shortly.

## Create a `.env` file

Using the [.env.example](./../.env.example) file as a temple, create a `.env` file that will contain your login credentials and API Token.

Here is what your `.env` might look like:

```txt
KINTONE_BASE_URL="https://example.kintone.com"
KINTONE_USERNAME="example@gmail.com"
KINTONE_PASSWORD="ILoveKintone!"
VITE_AUTHOR_ID="12345abcde67890"
VITE_API_TOKEN="09876edcba54321"
```

Paste your API Token from Medium into the `VITE_API_TOKEN` field, and your Author ID into the `VITE_AUTHOR_ID` field.

‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT DELETE THE [.env.example](./../.env.example) FILE!  
[.env.example](./../.env.example) is used by env-cmd to verify that `.env` file is correctly configured.

## Edit Your customize-manifest json

Next, we need to tell our uploading scripts which Kintone App we will be working on.

```json
{
    "app": "26",
    "scope": "ALL",
    ...
```

![images/customize-manifest.json](images/customize-manifest.png)

We can find our App ID number easily from the URL of our Kintone App.  
Go to your Kintone App and grab the URL. It should look this: `https://devevents.kintone.com/k/36/`  
Kintone App's URL follows this template: `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.kintone.com/k/<App ID>/show#record=<RECORD ID>`  
So then the `https://devevents.kintone.com/k/26/` URL tells us that this App's ID is `26`

## Edit main ts

For this workshop, we will only be coding in [main.ts](../src/main.ts). However, our actual API POST request logic is contained in [post_api.ts](../src/requests/post_api.ts). You can check out that file to see how the POST request to the medium.com API is structured.

Lastly, some TypeScript specific settings (type definitions!) are found in [fields.d.ts](../fields.d.ts). If you want to expand on this demo (adding an image stored in kintone to your article, for example), you will have to edit this file.

We have two goals for our coding:

1. Format our data (simply called `body` in [main.ts](../src/main.ts)) to send to the postToMedium function

2. Create a button to click, and when clicked, fire the postToMedium function.

First, let's look at our post body.

![images/1.png](images/1.png)

``` js
    // The body of our API POST request
    const body = {
      title: null, // The title of our article from our kintone record
      contentFormat: null, // String: The format we use: "markdown" or "html"
      content: null, // String: The body of our article, from our kintone record.
      tags: null, // Array: String "tags" for our article. Optional!
      publishStatus: null, // String: The status of our article: "public", "draft", or "unlisted"
      notifyFollowers: null // Boolean: Sends a notification after publishing.
    }
```

For reference, the [Medium.com API docs](https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs#33-posts) on POST Requests are pretty simple!

Our post title needs to come from our Kintone app. Remember that we set our `Title` field code to be lower-case `title` in our app. 

![images/1-2.png](images/1-2.png)

We can access the information on the show page easily in our code:

![images/1-3.png](images/1-3.png)

Next, according to the documentation, Medium articles can be submitted in either markdown, or html formats! Pretty cool. Let's go with `markdown` this time:

![images/2.png](images/2.png)

The content field should be our `Body` field from our app, which we designated with the `body` field code:

![images/3-2.png](images/3-2.png)

Just like above fill it in with the record variable:

![images/3-1.png](images/3-1.png)

Continue to fill in the body parameters. `tags` are up to you, depending on the contents of your article.
`publishStatus` is the status of your article. We are going to publish immediately, but saving to your medium.com account's `drafts` is also possible!
`notifyFollowers` will do exactly that, and takes a boolean, `true` or `false`. We're testing, so let's keep it as `false` for now.

![images/5.png](images/5.png)

And done! This should be good data to pass to our api call... but we'll need a button for our users to click in order to start the process.

![images/6-1.png](images/6-1.png)

Kintone allows you to append `HTML` elements to blank spaces in your Kintone App. When we setup our App, we added a `blank space`, and gave it the field code `publishToMedium`.

![images/6-2.png](images/6-2.png)

![images/6-3.png](images/6-3.png)

We tell our App where to append our button by matching the `HTML` IDs. Give your button an ID that matches the field code: `publishToMedium`.

![images/7.png](images/7.png)

Our App's custom `CSS` is contained in [style.css](../src/style.css). We can style our button with a CSS class, `uploadButton`.

Lastly, give our button a nice label, so our users can know what it does.

![images/8.png](images/8.png)

Last, we need our button to fire a function when clicked. That function should pass our post `body` data to the API function `publishToMedium`.

In the button's `onClick` function, call the `publishToMedium` function we imported from [post_api.ts](../src/requests/post_api.ts).

## Build & Upload the customization

With this, we can save our work and run kintone-customize-uploader!
(See the [slides.pdf](../slides.pdf) for more info!) Run `npm run start` in your terminal. Navigate to your app, create a record with some markdown in it, and click the publish button!
Navigate to your publications on [medium.com](www.medium.com/me) and bathe in your new found journalistic fame!

Good luck coding!
